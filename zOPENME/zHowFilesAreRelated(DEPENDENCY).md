# 🧠 Project Architecture Overview

This document outlines the **core structure** of your Flask-based project and explains the **role, purpose, and dependencies** of each key component.  
Think of it as a “system map” — showing how every part communicates to make the app function seamlessly.

---

## ⚙️ **1. `app.py` — The Brain & Engine

### 🎯 Role
The **main driver** of your application.  
It:
- Initializes the Flask server  
- Defines all routes (URLs/endpoints)  
- Manages user requests and responses  
- Interacts with the database (`todo.db`)  

### 🔗 Dependencies
- **`templates/`** — for rendering Jinja2-powered HTML pages  
- **`static/`** — for serving CSS, JS, and images  
- **`instance/todo.db`** — for reading/writing persistent data  

**In essence:** `app.py` is the *controller layer* — it orchestrates how the app behaves, connects logic with visuals, and communicates with the database.

---

## 🎨 **2. `templates/` — The View / User Interface**

### 🎯 Role
Houses all **HTML templates** powered by **Jinja2 templating engine**.  
Templates dynamically generate pages by embedding Python logic directly into HTML.

**Key Files:**
- `base.html` → The master layout template  
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `update.html` → Extend `base.html` to reuse the same design and structure  

### 🔗 Dependencies
- Fully dependent on **`app.py`** to render dynamic data (Jinja2 syntax won’t work without Flask).  
- References files from **`static/`** (like CSS and JS).  

**In essence:** This is the *presentation layer* — defining how users see and interact with your app.

---

## 🧩 **3. `static/` — The Styling & Interactivity**

### 🎯 Role
Contains all **static assets** — files that are not generated dynamically.

**Typical Contents:**
- `css/style.css` → Controls visuals: layout, colors, fonts, responsiveness  
- `js/test.js` → Adds interactivity and client-side logic  
- `1.png` → A sample image used in the UI  

### 🔗 Dependencies
- Referenced within HTML templates inside **`templates/`**.  
- Served by Flask as static files when users load the web page.  

**In essence:** This is the *front-end layer* — powering design, animation, and user engagement.

---

## 🗄️ **4. `instance/todo.db` — The Memory**

### 🎯 Role
This is your **SQLite database file**, which acts as the memory of your application.  
It stores all persistent data — in this case, the **tasks** of your To-Do app.

### 🔗 Dependencies
- Created and maintained by **`app.py`** using Flask-SQLAlchemy.  
- The app depends on this file to **persist and retrieve data** between user sessions.  

**In essence:** This is the *data layer* — ensuring your tasks remain saved even after the app restarts.

---

## 🔄 **5. The Flow — How Everything Works Together**

Below is a simplified request–response cycle for your Flask project:

🧍 User visits a URL.

⚙️ app.py receives the request

🗄️ Reads/writes data in instance/todo.db (if needed)

🧩 Renders an HTML file from templates/

🎨 That HTML tells the browser to load CSS/JS/images from static/

💻 The user sees a styled, dynamic, interactive web page

## 🧭 **Summary Table**

| Component | Role | Depends On | Acts As |
|------------|------|-------------|----------|
| `app.py` | Core logic & routing | `templates/`, `static/`, `instance/todo.db` | 🧠 Controller |
| `templates/` | HTML + Jinja2 templates | `app.py`, `static/` | 🎨 View |
| `static/` | CSS, JS, images | `templates/` | 🧩 Front-End Assets |
| `instance/todo.db` | SQLite database | `app.py` | 🗄️ Data Layer |

---

## ✅ **In a Nutshell**

> **“Flask is the conductor; Templates are the orchestra; Static files are the instruments; Database is the memory.”**

Together, they create a **complete, dynamic web application** — cleanly separated into logic, visuals, assets, and data storage.
